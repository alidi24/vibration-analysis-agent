**Capstone project for the [5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents)**

Multi-agent AI system for vibration analysis using Google ADK. Orchestrator routes requests to specialized agents (time-domain, frequency-domain, plotting) for FFT, Welch PSD, envelope analysis &amp; trend monitoring of wind turbine drivetrain data via natural language queries.

## Overview

**VibrationAgent** is a multi-agent system that assists data scientists in exploring wind turbine vibration data through natural language. Instead of writing repetitive analysis code, simply ask questions and get results.

### Example Queries

```
"What data is available in the system?"

"Load vibration data for turbine WT05, Main Bearing, on January 15, 2025 
and compute time-domain statistics."

"Perform FFT analysis and show me the dominant frequencies."

"Calculate the envelope spectrum using Hilbert transform."

"Plot RMS trend for turbine WT05 for the entire month of January 2025."
```

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrator delegates to specialized time-domain, frequency-domain, and plotting agents
- **Natural Language Interface**: Query data and request analyses conversationally
- **Domain-Specific Tools**: Vibration analysis functions (RMS, FFT, Welch PSD, envelope, spectrogram)
- **Session Management**: Maintains context across conversation turns
